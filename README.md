# Library-email-service-automation

A libray manager needs to send emails to his customers so
instead of repeating the process over and over, I wrote a python 
program that reads the emails of the customers from a csv file and
send an email for everyboby in the list.  

# What the manager needs to do
he need to navigate to https://myaccount.google.com/security
and configure the 2-steps verfication and he needs to add an 
app password and save this password to use it when sending emails.
